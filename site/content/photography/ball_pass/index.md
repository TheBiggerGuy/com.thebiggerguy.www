A photo taken on a "Introductory Mountaineering Course" run by [Alpine Recreation](http://www.alpinerecreation.com/intromountaineering.html). In upper left is [Aoraki/Mount Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aoraki_/_Mount_Cook) with the Ball Glacier bellow and the Caroline Hut bellow the peak the photo is taken on towards the right. This is around the [Ball Pass Crossing](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/aoraki-mount-cook-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/ball-pass-crossing/description/) which gives amazing views of both Mount Cook and [Tasman Glacier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasman_Glacier).
