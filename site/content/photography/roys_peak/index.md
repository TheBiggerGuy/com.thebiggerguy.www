I spend a night at the top of [Roys Peak](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/wanaka-area/things-to-do/roys-peak-track/) to photograph the sunset and sunrise from the "[The Best View in New Zealand](https://www.theworldisacircus.com/2016/04/walking-roys-peak/). After I walked the [Skyline Track](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/wanaka-area/things-to-do/skyline-track/). Unfortunately failed to hitch a lift to the base of Roys Peak, an extra 7Km, and failed to hitch back from the Skyline Track, another 8.88Km.
