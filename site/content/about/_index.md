            <h3>About Guy <i>(corporate version)</i></h3>
            <p>
                I am a Software Engineer with over three years experience working in large distributed web, analytics and machine learning systems. Working independently and in small teams, I have produced highly available systems at scale in an agile way as well as maintaining legacy systems in a pragmatic way. I have experience working on embedded systems, with power constraints, as well as global fleets of cloud services, with low latency requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am an enthusiastic person who enjoys research and development of cutting edge technologies. I to strive for optimal solutions in my work but am also able to prototype quickly and produce novel solutions to adapting requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work I have a passion for the outdoors and photography. I find working with wildlife and getting into the wilderness a great antidote to the sometimes intangible aspects of software development.

            <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
            <p>
                At <b>Amazon</b> I primarily worked on the Dynamic Advertising program. This team serves millions of personalized adverts to Amazon customers worldwide, buying impressions in real time auctions and algorithmically delivering the most relevant advert at the correct price. This involved working on large scale, low latency services connected to multi terabyte machine learning and analytics platforms.

            <p>
                At <b>Lisle Design</B> I worked for this start-up company progressing through production, testing, development and finally to R&D. This all centred around low power and easy to use appliances and a Bluetooth to Email transport system for low end mobile phones. Within these roles, I worked on optimised firmware flashing tools, SD card and file system recovery tools, mobile phone applications and embedded assembly working with custom first and third party electronics.
